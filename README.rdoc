= Ruby driver for the Delcom USB HID Visual Signal Indicator RGY (904000, generation II)

Provides a simple interface to turn on/off the red, green and yellow LEDs.

It should be pretty trivial to adapt this driver to work with any generation II signal indicator, however I only have access to the RGB version.

== Requirements

* ruby-usb: http://www.a-k-r.org/ruby-usb

== Example usage

  require 'timeout'
  require 'delcom_904008'

  light = Delcom::SignalIndicator.new

  begin
    Timeout::timeout(5) do
      loop do
        light.red
        sleep 0.1
        light.off
        sleep 0.05
      end
    end
  rescue Timeout::Error
    light.off
  end

  light.close
